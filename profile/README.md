## Engineering-First Approach
We build tools for developers who need more than just a prototype. While Python dominates research, we focus on **production-grade infrastructure**.

### Why Go?
Currently, our core stack is built on **Golang** to provide:
- **Performance:** Minimal latency and memory footprint.
- **Concurrency:** Native goroutines for handling multiple agent requests effortlessly.
- **Deployment:** Single static binary distribution. No "dependency hell."
